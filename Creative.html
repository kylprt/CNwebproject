    <h3><p>My experiences over the last few years have led me to begin developing some creative projects of my own. These projects are on various scales, from small text games to whole game settings and systems. Some have been in the works for a long time, particularly Odd's End. Others are relatively new, or have been dredged up from forgotten hard-drives. </p></h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Odd's End</h2>
    <div class = text_section>
    <p>Odd's End is a weird fiction/cosmic horror TTRPG (Tabletop Role Playing Game) drawing inspiration from gothic literature and the gothic revival. Building on similarly themed games such as <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/" target="_blank">Call of Cthulu</a> and <a href="https://www.loop-rpg.com/" target="_blank">Tales From the Loop</a>, as well as podcasts like <a href="http://www.welcometonightvale.com/" target="_blank">Welcome to Night Vale</a> it will focus on narrative storytelling. </p><p>Set in the rural township of Odd's End, a small and lonely settlement nestled among mist-topped mountains and surrounded by ancient and foreboding pine forests, players find themselves confronted by bizarre occurences, unnatural events and otherworldy creatures. Taking on the role of one of the town's many lost souls, players must use ingenuity, their characters' skills, and mysterious eldritch artefacts called Oddments to navigate the world, solve problems, search for answers, and ultimately keep themselves safe.</p></div>
    <br>
    <h2>Digital Storytelling</h2>
    <div class = text_section>
    <p>Following a course with Code Nation, which introduced me to coding, I have been working on a few interactive text-based games. I worked as part of a team to produce <a href="" target="_blank">The Dream Catcher</a> but  have since started work on a text-based sci-fi survival game called <a href="" target="_blank">ADRIFT</a>, in which the player takes on the role of a starship captain. In the face of unexpected events and obstacles, they must make decisions to balance the needs of their crew with the success of their mission.</p>
    <p>Stepping away from the production of games, I am also looking into the design of illustrated/animated novellas. Currently, I am working on two ideas. The first is aimed at children/young adults and uses monochromatic art to display a world divided into light and dark. It follows a young lamplighter as he journeys beyond his home to save his people. The second is a serial which follows an anonymous wanderer, making their way through a world built upon the bodies of ancient gods, maintained by close relationships between people and the spirits of their environments, and imperiled by irresponsible industrialisation.</p>
    <br> </div>
    <h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
    <div class = text_section>
    <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government-mandated lockdowns, I have been running various games of <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/" target="_blank">Dungeons and Dragons</a> via Zoom. During this time I have developed three distinct campaign settings for gameplay. The first, grounded in Greek mythology and owing substantial inspiration to the 3rd party <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arcanagames/arkadia-the-mythic-greek-setting-for-5e" target="_blank">Arkadia</a> setting by Arcana Games, is called <a href="Images/hellas.jpg" target="_blank">Hellas</a>. It uses a heavily simplified map of the adriatic sea, entirely real-world locations with fictionalised elements, and setting details such as city design, history and cosmology derived from Hellenic history.</p>
    <p>The second, taking greater inspiration from the Forgotten Realms setting of Dungeons and Dragons, is set in the <a href="Documents/sunderedlands.pdf" target="_blank">Sundered Lands.</a> A world fractured following a catastrophic event which brought the numerous planes and demiplanes of the traditional setting together with calamitous results. This is a world with multi-dimensional geographies, where worlds have been brought together so forcefully that they can no longer be considered seperate. Both the mystical feywild and the life-leeching shadowfell bleed into the realms of the material plane, but much stranger things are stirring.</p>
    <p>Finally, we come to my most recent campaign, set in a land called <a href="Images/concordia.jpg" target="_blank">Concordia.</a> In a world where good seems to have won and evil is on the retreat, a motley crew of villains are brought together by a secret organisation. Their aim? To cause chaos and tip the cosmological scales back in their favour.</p></div>
